This ModPack/Client Makes the game more optimal and somewhat different to use, without making it un-vanilla. With End Remastered as an example, you need to find the different eyes of enders. also, there are a lot of optimalisation mods and makes it even faster than Optifine! Many features that are handy are in this too! things like mouse tweaks. many features from Optifine are also here like dynamic lights, shaders, and a lot of options of Optifine in this. also is the world generation completely new with new biomes! it will use vanilla blocks so it won't look diffrent! and the nether and end biomes are also changed! The sounds are better fitting now with auditory. the game looks fancier by chat heads by example. You see from what i say that many is improved, and there is more! you can see more at features and every mod!

WORLD MAINTAIN ETC

above this text you will see the sorts of releases stable beta dev etc. this guide is over how to maintain your world and not get data corruption.
to be safe, always stay on an stable build because it haves all the mods that are needed. beta you may also can use but will have some missing mods but enough mods to run an world
without data corruption. dev stay away.

look always at an description of an release to see if it is supported and no data corruption can happen
what if an new mod is added for terrain questionmark

that can lead to data corruption and i almost forgot backup your worlds frequently

TROUBLESHOOTING

this new update corrupts my world what now
option 1 you will start an new fresh world 
option 2 remove the mod that is added and see if the world still works.
