This ModPack/Client Makes the game more optimal and somewhat different to use, without making it un-vanilla. With End Remastered as an example, you need to find the different eyes of enders. also, there are a lot of optimalisation mods and makes it even faster than Optifine! Many features that are handy are in this too! things like mouse tweaks. many features from Optifine are also here like dynamic lights, shaders, and a lot of options of Optifine in this. also is the world generation completely new with new biomes! it will use vanilla blocks so it won't look diffrent! and the nether and end biomes are also changed! The sounds are better fitting now with auditory. the game looks fancier by chat heads by example. You see from what i say that many is improved, and there is more! you can see more at features and every mod!
